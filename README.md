# Kirby Dev Starter

Based on the [kirby-kit](https://github.com/yoeran/kirby-kit) repository, this starter pack uses webpack, gulp, and more to make local development of this site super easy.

To get started, clone this repo for each site you want to build, then run:
```
npm install
```

#### Local development
```
gulp
```

#### Build files
```
gulp build
```
